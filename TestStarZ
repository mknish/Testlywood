Suitable Match

Plot

She was the perfect woman, intelligent, driven, and clear about what she needed in a partner. Then she met him. Charming, yes. But something was off. He didn’t meet her expectations. He lacked completeness, missing key traits she considered essential. His actions weren’t always correct, and his behaviour often felt inappropriate for the context of their relationship.
She wanted it to work. She believed in potential. But how could she commit to someone who didn’t meet her functional requirements?
Enter his AI companion, an advanced system designed to optimise human behaviour through continuous feedback and improvement. With its help, he begins a journey of transformation: identifying gaps in his emotional APIs, debugging his communication protocols, and deploying updates to improve his appropriateness and correctness in real time.
But just as he begins to align with her expectations, a rival appears, someone seemingly more complete, more correct, more appropriate. Will his improvements be enough to meet her functional suitability criteria? Or will she choose the one who was built to spec from the start?
